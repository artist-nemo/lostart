## What we all lost 30 years ago

On the morning of March 18, 1990, two thieves disguised as police officers broke into the the [https://www.gardnermuseum.org/about/theft](Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum) in Boston and stole [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Storm_on_the_Sea_of_Galilee](The Storm on the Sea of Galilee) and 12 other works in what is considered to be the biggest art theft in U.S. history. The museum still displays the paintings' empty frames in their original locations, and the heist remains unsolved.

On March 18, 2013, the FBI announced that they knew who was responsible for the crime. Criminal analysis has suggested that the heist was committed by an organized crime group. There have been no conclusions made public, as the investigation is [https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/03/18/six-theories-behind-stolen-gardner-museum-paintings/JmwHou86qo5MtBzX1fb9cI/story.html](ongoing).

The FBI has valued the haul at $600 million dollars.

The missing works of art have never been recovered.
